Read me:

A user of the program only has three inputs to make, to run the 
program successfully. These inputs include; selecting the raster grid 
of heights file (in row 27); typing in the number of rows and number 
of columns of the heights raster (in rows 18 and 19 respectively). On 
launching the model superclass (max gradient.py), the user is expected 
to activate the Gradient class by running the ‘gradientframework.py’ 
file before running the model superclass.
